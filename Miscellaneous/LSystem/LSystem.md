# LSystem

## Some notes

A string of characters is rewritten each iteration based on some rules
eg you start with an 'F' in generation zero, and at each iteraction you can rewrite as F+F-F-FF+F+F-F
Assign the characters to actions, like F = draw forward, + = turn right, - = turn left

Biological Systems - You could represent the growth computationally
You can model leaves
Can simulate tropisms (growth in response to stimuli)
