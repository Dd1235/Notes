# Socket Programming in Java

## Sockets 
[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iHMMo7SDfQ)

- Sockets are the one and only API between application and transform layer
- Two socket types for two transform services:
    - UDP: unreliable datagram
    - TCP: reliable byte stream-oriented
- with UDP: there is no "conection" ie a handshake between client and server
    - sender explicitly attaches IP destination address and port # to each packet
    - receiver extracts sender IP and port# from received packet
    - transmitted data may be lost of received out of order
- with TCP:
    - cliest must contact server (srver must have created socket that welcomes client's contact)
    - clients create a TCP socket, specifying IP address, port number of server process
    - when contact, server TCP creates a new socket for that client
        - source port numbers used to distinguish clients

## Websockets: 
- operates over TCP
- HTTP 1.0 client always makes a request and server has to send reponse
    -  when client sends first get, you close the connection, again open for the nest get and so one
- HTTP 1.1 web sockets built on this, make TCP request, leave it oprn, so header called Keep Alive, so open, request response, request response, and the close
- open, websocket handshake, no longer stateless but stateful, binary protocol, detached from HTTP, they have API access to underlying TCP
ws:// or wss:// first request is a normal HTTP get request like 1.1, but there is an **UPGRADE** header in that request, if the server knows server is trying ot upgrade, and server is cool iwth it, sends 101 (Switching protocols),
- why do we need it? chatting, live feed, multiplayer gaming, showing client progress/logging, we need this 



## Basics

There are two types of sockets: 
- TCP sockets: use `Socket` and `ServerSocket` class
- UDP sockets: `DatagramSocket` and `DatagramPacket`

`telnet` or `netcat` are helpful for testing.

TCP:
- Server: 
    - use `ServerSocket` 
    - Accept client request using `accept()` which returns  `Socket`
- Client:
    - use `Socket` to connect to the server
    - use `InputStream` and `OutputStream` for data exchange

### Blocking io


Blocking emans that a thread waits until an event occurs. If a method is a **blocking method** , then a call to that method can **block**, waiting until some event occurs before it returns to the caller.

When the incoming sockets buffer is empty, calling `read` blocks until data ae available
When a destination socket's buffer is full, calling `write` blocks util space is available.

`ServerSocket.accept()` and `in.readLine()` are blocking. Server needs a new thread to handle I/O with each new client. 

```java
// Server.java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class Server {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(5000)) {
            System.out.println("Server is listening on port 5000");
            Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
            System.out.println("Client connected");

            BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
            PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);

            String message;
            while ((message = input.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println("Received: " + message);
                output.println("Echo: " + message);
            }
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

```java
// Client.java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 5000)) {
            BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
            PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);

            BufferedReader consoleInput = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
            String message;
            while ((message = consoleInput.readLine()) != null) {
                output.println(message);
                System.out.println(input.readLine());
            }
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Blocking I/O doesn't scale well for enterprise applications

One thread handles multiple connections

### Java NIO: Non Blocking IO


```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.*;

public class NIOServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Selector selector = Selector.open();
        ServerSocketChannel serverChannel = ServerSocketChannel.open();
        serverChannel.configureBlocking(false);
        serverChannel.bind(new InetSocketAddress(5000));
        serverChannel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT);

        System.out.println("Server started...");

        while (true) {
            selector.select();
            for (SelectionKey key : selector.selectedKeys()) {
                if (key.isAcceptable()) {
                    SocketChannel clientChannel = serverChannel.accept();
                    clientChannel.configureBlocking(false);
                    clientChannel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ);
                    System.out.println("Client connected...");
                } else if (key.isReadable()) {
                    SocketChannel clientChannel = (SocketChannel) key.channel();
                    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
                    clientChannel.read(buffer);
                    buffer.flip();
                    System.out.println("Received: " + new String(buffer.array(), 0, buffer.limit()));
                    clientChannel.write(ByteBuffer.wrap("Message received".getBytes()));
                }
            }
            selector.selectedKeys().clear();
        }
    }
}
```
