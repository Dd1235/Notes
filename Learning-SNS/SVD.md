# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## Introduction

- Used in numerical linear algebra for data processing
- First step of most dimentionality reduction techniques
- Data driven generalization of the fourier transform
- "Tailored" to the specific problem
- A lot of features in common with the fourier transform
- basis for PCA
- used in the google page rank algorithm
- basis of facial recognotion algorithms
- used in recommendation systems
